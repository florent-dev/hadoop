# hadoop

## Description
Hadoop is an open-source framework that allows for processing and storing large amounts of data (big data) in a distributed manner across clusters of computers. It is built around two main components: HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) for data storage and MapReduce for data processing. The system is designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and capable of processing massive data volumes efficiently and quickly. Hadoop is widely used in big data environments to analyze constantly growing data volumes, making data processing more flexible and efficient.
